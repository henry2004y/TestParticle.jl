What makes plasmas particularly difficult to analyze is the fact that the densities fall in an intermediate range. Fluids like water are so dense that the motions of individual molecules do not have to be considered. Collisions dominate, and the simple equations of ordinaryy fluid dynamics suffice. At the other extreme in very low-density devices, only single-particle trajectories need to be considered; collective effects are often unimportant. Plasma behaves sometimes like fluids, and sometimes like a collection of individual particles. The first step in learning how to deal with this schizophrenic personality is to understand how single particles behave in electric and magnetic fields.

Here we assume that the EM fields are prescribed and not affected by the charged particles. The materials here closely follows F.F.Chen's [Introduction to Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-22309-4).
