# description: Tracing charged particle in dimensionless units
# ---

# This example shows how to trace charged particles in dimensionless units.
# After normalization, ``q=1, B=1, m=1`` so that the gyroradius ``r_L = mv_\perp/qB = v_\perp``.
# All the quantities are given in dimensionless units: if the magnetic field is homogeneous and the initial perpendicular velocity ``v_{\perp 0}^\prime`` is 4, then the gyroradius is 4.
# To convert them to the original units, ``v_\perp = v_{\perp}^\prime * U_0`` and ``r_L = r_L^\prime * l_0 = 4*l_0``.
# Check [Demo: single tracing with additional diagnostics](@ref demo_savingcallback) and [Demo: Dimensionless and Dimensional Tracing](@ref demo_dimensionless_dimensional) for explaining the unit conversion.

# Tracing in dimensionless units is beneficial for many scenarios. For example, MHD simulations do not have intrinsic scales. Therefore, we can do dimensionless particle tracing in MHD fields, and then convert to any scale we would like.

# Now let's demonstrate this with `trace_normalized!` and `trace_relativistic_normalized!`.

# In the relativistic case,
# * Velocity is normalized by speed of light c, $V = V^\prime c$;
# * Magnetic field is normalized by the characteristic magnetic field, $B = B^\prime B_0$;
# * Electric field is normalized by $E_0 = c\,B_0$, $E = E^\prime E_0$;
# * Location is normalized by the $L = c / \Omega_0$, where $\Omega_0 = q\,B_0 / m$, and
# * Time is normalized by $\Omega_0^{-1}$, $t = t^\prime * \Omega_0^{-1}$.

# In the small velocity scenario, it should behave similar to the non-relativistic case:
