# description: Tracing one charged particle with additional diagnostics
# ---

# This example demonstrates tracing one proton in an analytic E field and numerical B field.
# It also combines one type of normalization using a reference velocity `U₀`, a reference magnetic field `B₀`, and a reference time `1/Ω`, where `Ω` is the gyrofrequency.
# This indicates that in the dimensionless units, a proton with initial perpendicular velocity 1 under magnetic field magnitude 1 will possess a gyro-radius of 1.
# In the dimensionless spatial coordinates, we can zoom in/out the EM field to control the number of discrete points encountered in a gyroperiod.
# For example, if `dx=dy=dz=1`, it means that a particle with perpendicular velocity 1 will "see" one discrete point along a certain direction oriented from the gyro-center within the gyro-radius;
# if `dx=dy=dz=0.5`, then the particle will "see" two discrete points.
# MHD models, for instance, are dimensionless by nature. There will be customized (dimensionless) units for (x,y,z,E,B) that we needs to convert the dimensionless units for computing.
# If we simulate a turbulence field with MHD, we want to include more discrete points within a gyro-radius for the effect of small scale perturbations to take place. (Otherwise within one gyro-period all you will see is a nice-looking helix!)
# However, we cannot simply shrink the spatial coordinates as we wish, otherwise we will quickly encounter the boundary of our simulation.

# The `SavingCallback` from DiffEqCallbacks.jl can be used to save additional outputs for diagnosis. Here we save the magnetic field along the trajectory, together with the parallel velocity.
# Note that `SavingCallback` is currently not compatible with ensemble problems; for multiple particle tracing with customized outputs, see [Demo: ensemble tracing with extra saving](@ref demo_output_func).
