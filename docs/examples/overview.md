# [Examples](@id examples)

This section contains thorough examples for using TestParticle.jl. If you prefer to run the demos on your local computer with interactive support, we suggest switching from `using CairoMakie` (which is a Makie frontend for static 2D rendering) to `using GLMakie` (which is another Makie frontend for interactive 3D rendering).
